Yotpo Email Templates
=======

An express server that uses liquid to render the Yotpo email templates in the browser, which makes for easier styling. I would advise agains changing too much in the snippets and templates unless you know which elements are and aren't read only (there are A LOT).

##HOW TO USE

To start the server run `npm run devStart` in your console then in your browser go to `localhost:3000`.

If you're working in a file, READ THE COMMENTS. The comments will tell you things like: what sections are read only, what code should not be included in Yotpo, and other useful things.

##MORE INFO

**REMEMBER**: *This is mainly for styling emails. Not all email clients support some of the advanced HTML5/CSS3 things modern browsers do. Keep that in mind when making alterations.*
