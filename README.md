Yotpo Email Templates
=======

An express server that uses liquid to render the Yotpo email templates in the browser, which makes for easier styling. I would advise agains changing too much in the snippets and templates unless you know which elements are and aren't read only (there are A LOT).

If you would like to view a specific template, go into `layout.liquid` and change the template that is being included within `#content`.

To start the server run `npm start` in your console.
